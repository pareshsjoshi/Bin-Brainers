| **Selection Sort**  | Repeatedly selects the smallest element and swaps it with the first unsorted element. | O(n^2) / O(n^2) / O(n^2)                  | O(1) / O(1) / O(1)                      | Unstable      | Comparison-based sorting                  | Selection Algorithm                     | Simple but inefficient for large datasets.                           |
| **Insertion Sort**  | Builds the sorted array one item at a time by inserting elements into their correct position. | O(n) / O(n^2) / O(n^2)                   | O(1) / O(1) / O(1)                      | Stable        | Comparison-based sorting                  | Insertion Algorithm                     | Efficient for small datasets or nearly sorted data.                  |
| **Bubble Sort**     | Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.        | O(n) / O(n^2) / O(n^2)                   | O(1) / O(1) / O(1)                      | Stable        | Comparison-based sorting                  | Swapping Algorithm                      | Simple but generally inefficient for large datasets.                 |
| **Heapsort**        | Builds a heap and repeatedly extracts the maximum element to sort the array. | O(n log n) / O(n log n) / O(n log n)     | O(1) / O(1) / O(1)                      | Unstable      | Comparison-based sorting                  | Heap Algorithm                          | Efficient for large datasets; not stable due to heap operations.     |
| **Mergesort**       | Divides the array into halves, sorts them, and then merges them.          | O(n log n) / O(n log n) / O(n log n)     | O(n) / O(n) / O(n)                      | Stable        | Divide and conquer sorting                | Merge Algorithm                         | Requires additional memory for temporary arrays.                     |
| **Quicksort**       | Divides the array into partitions and sorts each partition recursively.   | O(n log n) / O(n log n) / O(n^2)         | O(log n) / O(log n) / O(n)              | Unstable      | Divide and conquer sorting                | Partitioning Algorithm                  | Efficient for large datasets; performance depends on pivot selection. |
