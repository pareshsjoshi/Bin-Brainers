Here's a summary of the main differences between a tree and a graph:

| **Feature**            | **Tree**                                                                 | **Graph**                                                                       |

| **Definition**          | A tree is a connected, acyclic graph with N nodes and N-1 edges.       | A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges, which can have cycles. |
| **Structure**           | Hierarchical structure (parent-child relationship).                    | Can be cyclic or acyclic, directed or undirected.                                |
| **Edges**               | Exactly N-1 edges for N nodes.                                          | Can have any number of edges (including more or fewer than N-1).                 |
| **Cycles**              | No cycles (acyclic).                                                    | Can contain cycles (cyclic or acyclic).                                          |
| **Root**                | Has a designated root node (in case of a rooted tree).                  | No root node required, though graphs can have designated starting points.        |
| **Traversal**           | Specific traversal methods like Preorder, Inorder, Postorder.           | Traversal methods include DFS, BFS, which are also applicable to trees.          |
| **Connectivity**        | Always connected (for all nodes).                                       | May or may not be connected.                                                     |
| **Applications**        | Used in hierarchical data structures (e.g., file systems, XML/HTML).    | Used in network routing, social networks, web page ranking, etc.                 |
