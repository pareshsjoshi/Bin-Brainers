Great! Let's go through these concepts one by one with explanations and shortcut formulas for solving problems.

---

### 1. **Percentage**
**Concept**: Percentage represents a fraction out of 100.  
**Formula**:  
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100
\]
**Shortcut**:  
- To find the percentage increase/decrease:  
  \[
  \text{Percentage Change} = \frac{\text{Change}}{\text{Original Value}} \times 100
  \]

---

### 2. **Profit & Loss**
**Concept**: Profit is the amount gained, and loss is the amount lost when selling goods.  
**Formulas**:  
- **Profit** = Selling Price (SP) – Cost Price (CP)
- **Loss** = Cost Price (CP) – Selling Price (SP)
- **Profit Percentage** = \( \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Cost Price}} \times 100 \)
- **Loss Percentage** = \( \frac{\text{Loss}}{\text{Cost Price}} \times 100 \)

---

### 3. **Simple Interest and Compound Interest**
- **Simple Interest (SI)**:  
  \[
  \text{SI} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
  \]
  where \( P \) is principal, \( R \) is rate, and \( T \) is time.

- **Compound Interest (CI)**:  
  \[
  \text{CI} = P \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^T - P
  \]
  where \( P \) is principal, \( R \) is rate, and \( T \) is time.

---

### 4. **Partnership**
**Concept**: In a partnership, profit is shared in the ratio of the capital invested and the time for which it is invested.
**Formula**:  
- Share of Profit = \( \frac{\text{Capital} \times \text{Time}}{\text{Total Capital of All Partners}} \)

---

### 5. **Algebraic Formulae**
- **Quadratic Equation**: \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \)
  Roots are given by:
  \[
  x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
  \]

- **Sum of \(n\) terms of an Arithmetic Series**:  
  \[
  S_n = \frac{n}{2} \left(2a + (n-1)d\right)
  \]
  where \(a\) is the first term, \(d\) is the common difference, and \(n\) is the number of terms.

---

### 6. **Number Theory**
- **LCM and HCF (GCD)**:  
  \[
  \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{HCF}(a, b)}
  \]
  
  - For two numbers \( a \) and \( b \), the least common multiple (LCM) and greatest common divisor (HCF or GCD) are related as shown.

---

### 7. **Mixtures & Alligations**
**Concept**: When two or more ingredients are mixed, the price or concentration of the mixture is found using the alligation method.

**Formula**:  
- **Alligation Method**:  
  \[
  \text{Mean Price} = \frac{(C_1 \times Q_1) + (C_2 \times Q_2)}{Q_1 + Q_2}
  \]
  where \( C_1, C_2 \) are the costs of the components and \( Q_1, Q_2 \) are their respective quantities.

---

### 8. **Circular Arrangement**
**Concept**: Arranging objects in a circle where the arrangement is considered the same if rotated.
- **Formula**:  
  Number of ways to arrange \(n\) objects in a circle is \( (n-1)! \).

---

### 9. **Ratio & Proportion**
**Concept**: Ratios represent the relative sizes of two quantities. Proportion indicates that two ratios are equal.
- **Formula**:  
  \[
  \frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} \quad \text{or} \quad a : b = c : d
  \]

---

### 10. **Time & Work**
**Concept**: Time taken to complete a task depends on the amount of work done and the rate of work.
**Formula**:  
- Work = Rate × Time
- If \( A \) and \( B \) work together, their combined rate is:
  \[
  \frac{1}{T} = \frac{1}{T_1} + \frac{1}{T_2}
  \]
  where \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) are the individual times taken.

---

### 11. **Time, Speed, and Distance**
**Concept**: Time, speed, and distance are related by the formula:  
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]
- Relative speed when two objects are moving in opposite directions:
  \[
  \text{Relative Speed} = \text{Speed}_1 + \text{Speed}_2
  \]
- Relative speed when two objects are moving in the same direction:
  \[
  \text{Relative Speed} = \left| \text{Speed}_1 - \text{Speed}_2 \right|
  \]

---

### 12. **Averages**
**Concept**: The average of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the count of numbers.
**Formula**:  
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all values}}{\text{Number of values}}
\]

---

### 13. **Probability**
**Concept**: Probability is the measure of the likelihood of an event occurring.
**Formula**:  
\[
P(E) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
\]
- For independent events:  
  \[
  P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B)
  \]
- For mutually exclusive events:  
  \[
  P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B)
  \]

---

### 14. **Series & Progression**
- **Arithmetic Progression (AP)**:  
  \( a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \times d \)
- **Geometric Progression (GP)**:  
  \( a_n = a_1 \times r^{(n-1)} \)

---

### 15. **Variation**
**Concept**: Direct variation and inverse variation.
- **Direct Variation**: \( y = kx \)
- **Inverse Variation**: \( y = \frac{k}{x} \)

---

### 16. **Ages**
**Concept**: Problems related to ages often involve algebraic equations based on given relationships between current and future ages.
- Example:  
  If a person’s age is related to another person’s age by a ratio, the equation can be solved algebraically.

---

### 17. **Linear Arrangement**
**Concept**: Arranging items in a straight line.
- **Formula**:  
  The number of ways to arrange \(n\) objects is \(n!\).

---

### 18. **Permutations and Combinations**
- **Permutations (Order matters)**:  
  \[
  P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
  \]
- **Combinations (Order doesn’t matter)**:  
  \[
  C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
  \]

---

### 19. **Rank & Ordering**
**Concept**: Problems dealing with relative positions in a group.
- **Rank from the top**: Count the number of people above.
- **Rank from the bottom**: Count the number of people below.

---

### 20. **Linear Equations**
**Concept**: Equations of the form \( ax + b = 0 \).
- **Formula**:  
  Solving for \( x \):  
  \[
  x = -\frac{b}{a}
  \]

---

### 21. **Caselet / Paragraph-Based Reasoning**
**Concept**: Problems involving data presented in a paragraph form, requiring logical deduction.
- **Approach**: Break down the paragraph into relevant data points and apply logical rules to answer questions.

---

### 22. **Data Interpretation**
**Concept**: Interpreting data from tables, graphs, or charts to answer questions.
- **Approach**: Carefully analyze data, find patterns, and use arithmetic/logic to derive answers.
