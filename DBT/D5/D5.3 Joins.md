D5.3 Joins

- All the data is stored in one table, data is stored in multiple tables
- If you want to see columns of 2 or more tables, then you will have to write a Joins

```sql
select dname, ename from emp, dept
where dept.deptno = emp.deptno;
```
- dept.deptno -> tableName.columnName
- emp.deptno -> tableName.columnName   
```dept -> right side table -> driving table```   
```emp -> left side table -> driven table```    
Full table scan - entire table is searched

| ENAME | DNAME |
|-----|-------|
| TRN | Arun |
| TRN | Ali |
| TRN | Kirun |
| EXP | Jack |
| EXP | Thomas |

```sql
--The position of columns in SELECT Clause will determine the position of columns in the output; this you will write as per Client Requirement.
select ename, dname from emp, dept
where dept.deptno = emp.deptno;
```
- WHERE clause can be written in any sequence
<table>
<tr>
<td>

```sql
select dname, ename from emp, dept
where dept.deptno = emp.deptno;
```
</td>
<td>

```sql
select dname, ename from emp, dept
where dept.deptno = emp.deptno;
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

- In order for the join to work faster, preferably the driving table should be table with lesser number of rows
<table>
<tr>
<td>

```sql
select dname, ename from emp, dept
where dept.deptno = emp.deptno;
--FAST
--dept -> driving table
--emp -> driven table
```
</td>
<td>

```sql
select dname, ename from emp, dept
where dept.deptno = emp.deptno;
--SLOW
--emp -> driving table
--dept -> driven table
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

- the common column in both table is deptno; the common column that is present in both the tables need not be the same in both the tables, because the same column may have a different meaning in the other table. eg. Export & Import, Purchase & Sale, etc.
```sql
select dname, ename from emp, dept
where dept.x = emp.y;
```
- The datatype of common columns in both the tables should be the same and there has to be some logical reason on whose basis you are writing the join
```sql
select dname, ename from emp, dept
where dept.deptno = emp.empno;
--output will be senseless
```
```sql
select dname, ename from emp, dept
where dept.deptno = emp.empno;
```
```sql
--To make output more presentable
select dname, ename from emp, dept
where dept.deptno = emp.empno
order by 1;
```
```sql
--It's good to display lots of columns in the output; it becomes richer & more meaningful
select dname, loc, ename, job, sal from emp, dept
where dept.deptno = emp.empno
order by 1;
```
```sql
--To display all the columns from both the tables (It'll may display common column 2 times)
select * from emp, dept
where dept.deptno = emp.empno
order by 1;
```
```sql
--Column is ambiguously defined (if common column had difference column names in both the tables, then this problem would not have arisen)
select deptno, dname, loc, ename, job, sal from emp, dept
where dept.deptno = emp.empno
order by 1;
```
- To overcome above error
- To avoid double columns
<table>

```sql
--It's good programming practice to use tablename.columname for all the columns, because it makes select statement more readable
