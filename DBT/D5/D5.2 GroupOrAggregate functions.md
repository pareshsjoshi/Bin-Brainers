<table>
<tr>
<td>

- Single-row function
	- Operate on 1 row at a time
	- Character, Number, Date & Time, List, Environment Functions
	- eg. upper(ename), round(sal), etc.
- Multi-Row function
	- Operate on multiple rows at a time
	- Group function
	- eg. sum(sal)

EMP Table   
    SAL   
    1000   
    2000   
    3000   
    4000   
    5000   
</td>
</tr>
</table>

```sql
select
case
when job = 'M' then 'Manager'
when job = 'C' then 'Clerk'
end "JOB"
from emp;
```
```sql
select sum(sal) from emp;
-- Output - 35000
```
- Assume 4th row sal is null

```sql
select sum(sal) from emp;
--Output 26000
-- Null values are not counted by group functions
```
<table>
<tr>
<td>

```sql
select avg(sal) from emp;
-- Output 26000/4 -> 6500
```
</td>
<td>

```sql
select avg(ifnull(sal,0)) from emp;
-- Output 26000/5 -> 5200
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<table>
<tr>
<td>

```sql
select min(sal) from emp;
-- Output -> 3000
```
</td>
<td>

```sql
select min(ifnull(sal,0)) from emp;
-- Output -> 0
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

```sql
select max(sal) from emp;
-- Output -> 8000
```
```sql
select count(sal) from emp;
-- Output -> 4 - Returns count of number of rows where SAL is not having a null value
```
```sql
select count(*) from emp;
-- Output -> 4 - Returns count of total number of rows int the table
```
```sql
select count(*) from emp;
--How may employees
select count(sal) from emp;
--How many are salaried
select count(*) - count(sal) from emp;
--How many are not salaried;
select max(sal)/min(sal) from emp;
--8000/3000 = 2.67
select sum(sal)/count(*) from emp;
--26000/5 = 5200	FASTER
select avg(ifnull(sal,0)) from emp;
--26000/5 = 5200	SLOWER
```
- Discard the assumption for 4th row
```sql
select sum(sal) from emp;
where deptno = 1;
--Output - 18000;
select avg(sal) from emp;
where job = 'C';
-- Output - 6000
```
```sql
--Count Query (Counting number of query hits)
select count(*) from emp
where sal>7000;
-- Returns number of emps whos salary is > 7000
```
sum(column)
avg(column)
min(column)		min(sal)	ename, hiredate
max(column)		max(sal)	ename, hiredate
count(column)	count(sal)	ename, hiredate
count(*)
stddev(column)
variance(column)
```sql
select count(*), min(sal), max(sal), sum(sal), avg(sal)
 from emp;
--OUTPUT -
count(*)	min(sal)	max(sal)	sum(sal)	avg(sal)
14			800			5000		29025		2073
```
##### Restriction for group functions
1. You cannot select column of table along with a group function
```sql
select count(ename), max(sal) from emp;
--OK
select ename, max(sal) from emp;
--Not OK, ename return multiple rows whereas max(sal) returns only 1 row
--ERROR -> Not a single-group group function
```
2. You cannot select single-row function along with a group function
```sql
select count(ename), max(sal) from emp;
--OK
select upper(ename), max(sal) from emp;
--Not OK, 
```

3. You cannot use group function in where clause, as where is executed in Sever HD and group-function executed in Server RAM
```sql
select * from emp where sal>avg(sal);
```

### GROUP BY Clause
- Used for grouping

```sql
select sum(sal) from emp;
--Output 35000

select sum(sal) from emp
where deptno = 1; 
--Output 18000

select deptno, sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno;
select sum(sal) from emp;
```
- Steps followed in Group By clause
1. Rows retrieved from DB Server HD to Server RAM
2. Sorting will take place deptno wise
3. Gouping is done deptno wise
4. Summation deptno wise
5. HAVING clause
6. ORDER BY clause

SELECT Clause - select deptno, sum(sal) FROM Clause - from emp
GROUP BY Clause group by deptno;

- Rule
1. Besides the group function, whichever column is present in select,it has to be present in GROUP BY clause 
```sql
select deptno, sum(sal) from emp;
--Not OK
select deptno, sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno;
--OK
```
2. Whichever column is present in GROUP BY Clause, it may or maynot be present in SELECT Clause
```sql
select sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno;
/*	Output
	sum(sal)
	18000
	17000
```
```
EMP Table
SAL           DeptNO
1000             10
2000             10
3000             20
4000             30
5000             40
```
```sql
select deptno, sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno;
select deptno, min(sal) from emp
group by deptno;
select deptno, max(sal) from emp
group by deptno;
select deptno, avg(sal) from emp
group by deptno;
select deptno, count(*) from emp
group by deptno;
```
- 2D Query
	- Any SELECT Statement with a GROUP BY clause is known as 2D Query, bcz you can plot a graph from the OUTPUT. eg. bar graph, pie chart, etc.
- MySQL for Excel, Oracle Graphics, Oracle Apex, etc.   

![table](/DBT/D5/Table3.png)
```sql
select deptno, sum(sal) from emp
where sal>7000
group by deptno;
```
- WHERE clause is specified before the GROUP BY clause
```sql
select deptno, sum(sal) from emp
where sal>7000 and sal<10000
group by deptno;
```
```sql
select deptno, sum(sal) from emp
where job='C'
group by deptno;
```
```sql
select job, sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno;
```
```sql
select deptno, job, sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno, job;
```
- There is no upper limit on number of columns in GROUP BY Clause
- eg. select ...........
	group by city, state, city;
- If you have a large number of rows in table & if you have a large number of columns in GROUP BY Clasuse, then the SELECT statement will be very slow, bcz that much sorting has to takes place in Server RAM
- If you have 1 column in group by clause then it's known as 2D Query
- If you have 2 column in group by clause then it's known as 3D Query
- If you have 3 column in group by clause then it's known as 4D Query
- And so on..., it's knwon as Multi-Dimensional queries (also known as Spatial queries)
```sql
select .......
group by city, country, district, state;
--Slower
select .......
group by country, state, district, city;
--Faster
```
```sql
select sum(sal), deptno, job from emp
group by job, deptno;
```
- The position of columns in SELECT clause and position of columns in GROUP BY Clause need not be the same
- The position of columns in SELECT Clause will determine the position of columns in out; this you will write as per user requirement.
- The position of columns in GROUP BY clause will determine the sorting order, grouping order, summation order and hence the speed of processingl this you will write as per count(disting(coluymn_name))
- select count(distinct deptno), count(disting job) from emp;
```sql
select count(distinct deptno), count(disting job) from emp;
```
```sql
select deptno, sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno
having sum(sal) > 17000;
--WHERE clause is used for searching
--searching takes place in DB Server HD
--WHERE clause is used to restrict the rows
--WHERE clause is used to restrict the rows from DB Server HD to Server RAM
--Having clause works after the summation is done
```
```sql
select deptno, sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno
having sal > 17000;		-- <-ERROR
```
- whichever column is present in SELECT clause, it can be used in HAVING clause
- It's recommendend that only the group functions should be used in HAVING Clause
<table>
<tr>
<td>

```sql
select deptno, sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno
having sum(sal) > 17000;
```
</td>
<td>

```sql
select deptno, sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno
having sum(sal) > 17000 and sum(sal) < 25000;
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

```sql
select deptno, sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno
order by 2;
```
- ORDER BY clause is LAST clause in SELECT statement
```
select ...... from ......
where ......
group by ......
having ......
order by ......;
```
- Matrix report
```sql
select deptno, count(*), max(sal), sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno
order by 1;
DEPTNO	COUNT(*)	MIN(Sal)	SUM(Sal)
10		3			1300		8750
20		5			
30		6			950			9400
```
```sql
select deptno, sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno;
deptno	sum(sal)
1		18000
2		17000

select sum(sal) from emp
group by deptno;
sum(sal)
18000
17000

select max(sum(sal)) from emp
group by deptno;
max(sum(sal))
18000
--NESTING OF GROUP FUNCTIONS IS SUPPORTED BY ORACLE
```
**Interesting**
```sql
select sum(sal) sum_sal from emp
group by deptno;
sum_sal
18000
17000

select max(sum_sal) from 
select sum(sal) sum_sal from emp
group by deptno) abcd;
abcd
18000
```
