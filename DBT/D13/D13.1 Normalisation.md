D13.1 Normalisation

## NORMALISATION

- Implement extension columns
- Reserver

### 4TH NORAL FORM
- Extension to 3rd normal form
- Also known as BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Forma)
- Introduced sometime in the mid 1990's
- You may or may not implement 4th nornal form
- Used to maintain the integrity of data
- normally used on public network, e.g. internet

- If the data is large, if the select statement, you add an extra to the column to the table, and store the totals over there
- Normally done for computed columns, expressions, function-based columns, summery columns, formula columns, etc. e.g. itemtotal, ototal.
- This is DENORMALISE
- used to improve the performance, to make SELECT statement work faster
- In some situations you may want to add extra table to the application. e.g.,
```
	DEPTOTO
--------------
DEPTNO	SALTOT
------	------
  1		 15000
  2		  6000
```

- Disadvantage of DENORMALISE
	1. DML will be slow
	2. Data redundancy
- Advantage of DENORMALISE
	1. SELECT statement will be fast
