D13.2 NoSQL

## NoSQL
- New technology
- Not Only SQL (SQL is not the only language for database problems)(Other query language exist)

#### History
- Earlier we had DBMS
- Mid 1980's Rise of RDBMS
##### Benifits of RDBMS
1. SQL (Common for all RDBMS)(All RDBMS can communicate with each other)
2. Data persistence (RDBMS maintains Read & Write consistency)
Complex transactions
4. Excellent reporting tools available, e.g. Oracle, reports, Oracle Graphics, Acuate, Seagate's Crystal Reports, etc
5. Integration mechanism across application

##### Problems with RDBMS model
 Impedance Mismatch -> One logical group of fields in the memory is splattered accross multiple tables in the database

##### Soluntion
- Mid 1990's Rise of Object databases, e.g. Oracle, etc.
- Development in the world
	- In early 2000's Rise of Internet
	- Vertical Scaling - Upgrading server by EXPANDING hardware
##### Problem with Scaling vertically
1. Very exprensive
2. Very difficult to implement
3. Hardware has a limit

##### Solution
- Scaling Horizontally - Upgrading server by EXTENDING hardware
- Lots little boxes sharing the load
- Grid of servers

##### Problem with Scaling horizontally
- SQL is not designed to work well with a multi-node system

##### Solution
- Grid computing & Cloud computing
- HAAS - Hardware As A Service
- PAAS Platform 
- SAAS - Software 
- IAAS - Infrastructure
e.g. Oracle 23.1
Google -> BigTable
Amazon -> Dynamo

##### **Birth of NoSQL**
- Johan Oskarsson (Pronoucation - Yohan) (from Hadoop, based London)
- Twitter hashtag - #NoSQL,
- Thursday, 11th June, 2009
- 10 AM to 5 PM
- San Francisco
- Antendees:-
	- MongoDB - Mangoos DB
	- CouchDB
	- Project Voldemort - A distributed database
	- Hypertable
	- Dynomite
	- Cassandra (Egiptian word, eye of a women)
	- Apache HBASE
	- etc....


### Definition of NoSQL
- No definition of NoSQL

### Characteristics of NoSQL
1. Open-source
2. Non-relational
3. Cluster-friendly (ability to run on large clusters)(horizontal scalibility)
4. Designed for 21st Century Web (high trafic websites)
5. Schema-less

### Data Models
1. Document database
	- Store documents, e.g. MongoDB, CouchDB, Raven DB
2. Column family database
	- Every column is file, e.g. Cassandra, Apache HBASE
3. Graph database
	- Store graphs, maps, e.g. Neo4j - NoSQL for the Enterprise
4. Key-value database
	- Based on hashing algorithm
	- From the value of the fields it will generate the HD address
	- Designed for fast retrievel
	- Free HD space has to be allocated in advance
	- Used for historical data; for data warehousing applications
	- e.g. Project Voldemort - A distributed database, riak, redis

### NoSQL
- What is NoSQL
	- It is a type of database management system

- What are vrious database management system
	1. RDBMS
	2. OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)
	3. NoSQL

 - What are objective of NoSQL
	- Focused to provide
	1. Scalability
	2. Performance
	3. High Availability

<tr>
<td>

```
RDBMS
1. More functionality
2. Less performance
3. Tables
4. Stuctured data
```

<td>

```
NoSQL
1. Less functionality
2. More performance
3. Collections
4. Structured & Unstructured data
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

- What is missing in NoSQL
	1. No joins support
	2. No complex transactions support
	3. No constraints support

- What is available in NoSQL
	1. Query language (Other than SQL) ("Not only SQL")
	2. Fast performance
	3. Horizontal scalability

- When to use NoSQL
	1. The ability to store & retrieve great quantities of data is important
	2. Storing the relationship between the elements in not important
	3. Dealing with growing lists of elements, e.g. Twitter postes, Internet server logs, Blogs.
	4. Data is not structured or structure is changing with time
	5. Prototypes or fast applications need to be developed
	6. Constraints and validations logic is not required to be implemented in the database
	
- When not to use NoSQL
	1. Complex transactions need to be handles
	2. Joins must be handles ny the databases
	3. Validations must be handled by the databases

Most companies using RDBMS as well as NoSQL, some data like payment, etc SQL, other in MongoDB

## MongoDB
- Sponsored by 10gen
- JSON-style documents representd as BSON (Binory JSON)
```JSON
{"hello":"world"} -> \x16\x00\x00\x00\x02hello\x00\x06\x00\x00\x00world\x00\x00
```

JavaScript Object Notation
json.org/bsponspec.org

- Felxible "schemas"
```JSON
{"ename":"Scott","job":"CLERK"}
{"ename":"King","city":"Mumbai","job":"MANAGER","emailid":["..",".."]}
```

- _id field
- every document has a _id field
- Equivalent to Primary key of RDBMS
```
ObjectID(4bface1a223136e04fec434")
	timestamp
			machine id
					process id
							counter
```
- _id is lightweigth occupying 12 bytes of storage
- Generated on client end to reduce load on database server
- Many supported platforms/languages
- Driver for PHP, Perl, C++, C#, .Net, Python, Ruby
- Available on all major OS 32/64 bit
- MongoDB v2.7 is the last version to support 32 bit OS
- v3.2 onwards only 64 bit OS is supported

### Steps to install MongoDB
- Run MongoDB setup
- Next -> Accept & Next -> Setup type Complete -> Install
- UAC -> Yes (Allow)
- Finish
### Post-Install Steps
- MongoDB gets installed in C:\Program Files\MongoDB
- Go to C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.2\bin
- mongod.exe - To start DB
- mongo.exe - To start MongoDB Command Line
- MongoDB requires a data directory to store all the data
- Create folder-> C:\MongoDB\Data
- Add C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.2\bin to path variable of windows (environmental variables)
- To start the database 
	- Go to CMD,
	- Go to C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.2\bin folder
	- \bin> mongod --dbpath C:\MongoDB\Data
	- If your path includes spaces, enclose path in double quotes
	- Waiting for connection on port 27017  
	Do not close this window

- To connect to MongoDB
	- Open another CMD
	- Go to C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.2\bin folder
	-\bin> mongo
	- It says connecting to test

### MongoDB Commands
	
- These are case sensative
- ENTER key is end of command
- Give "help" command
	- Will show mongodb commands
	
- To show databases
	`show dbs`

- To create a new database
	`use cdac`
	- If cdac db exists, it'll connect to it, otherwise it'll create and connect to it
	
- To see currently selected DB
	`db`

- We created cdac batabase, it says connected to db, but it doesn't show in list.
- You should have at least on collection in it

- To see Collections
`show collections;`

- To drop database
`db.dropDatabase()
	- this will drop the selected db. If you have not selected any db, then it will drop 'test' database

- To create collection
`db.createCollection("library")

- To drop collection
`db.collection_name.drop()` | `db.library.drop()`

- To insert a document in library collection
```shell
db.collection_name.insert(document)
db.library.insert({title:'MongoDB programming', author:'Sameer',likes:100})
```

- To view the data, we have to use find method
```shell
db.collection_name.find()
db.library.find()
```
	- Observer the _id field (equivalent to Primary key)

- To insert another document
```shell
db.library.insert({title:'MySQL programming', authors:['Jack','Jill'], likes:200,qty:20,price:11})
```

- To make it more presentable, we have pretty method
`db.library.find().pretty()`

- We have findOne() method, returns 1st document
`db.library.findOne()

- To update document
```shell
db.collection_name.update(selection_criteria, updated_data)
db.library.update({author:'Sameer'},{$set:{author:'Sameer Dehadrai'}})
```
- Use prettu() method to view it
`db.library.find().pretty()`

- Delete document
```shell
db.collection_name.remove(deletion_criteria)
```
Let us delete the document that has 100 like
```shell
db.library.remove({like:100})
```

- To exit from MongoDB shell
`exit`

### To SHUT DOWN MongoDB Database
- Exit MongoDB shell
- Press ctrl+C in terminal where mongod instance is running
