12.2 Normalization

## NORMALIZATION

- Applicable for RDBMS(e.g. MySQL) & ORDMS (e.g. Oracle)
- Concept of table design
- RDBMS -> 1st to 4th Normal Form
- ORDBMS -> 1st to 9th Normal Form
- What tables to create, structures, columns, datatypes, widths, constraints
- Based on User Requirements
- It's part of Design phase (min 1/6)
- aim of Normalization is to have "efficient" table structure
- Aim of Normalization is to avoid the data redundancy (avoid the unnecessary duplication of data)
- Secondary aim of Normalization is to reduce the problems of insert, update, & delete
- Normalization is done from input perspective
- Normalization is done from forms perspective
- VIEW THE ENTIRE APPLICATION ON A PER-TRANCACTION BASIS, & YOU NORMALISE EACH TRANSACTION SEPARATELY
- e.g. CUSTOMER_PLACE_AN_ORDER, CUSTOMER_CANCELS_THE_ORDER, GOODS_ARE_DELIVERED, CUSTOMER_MAKES_PAYMENT, CUSTOMER_RETURNS_THE_GOODS, etc.
- Primary key is by-product of Normalisation

### GETTING READY FOR NORMALISATION
- CUSTOMER_PLACE_AN_ORDER
1. For a given transactions, make a list of fields
2. Ask the client for some sample data
3. With the permission & involment of client, strive for atomicity
	- Column is divided into sub-columns, and sub-columns are divided into sub-sub_columns, e.g. address can be divided into flat no, street, landmark, etc.
4. For every column, make list of column properties
	- e.g. pincode should be numeric, no decimal, positive, 6 digits, fixed length, mandatory, etc
	- e.g. address should be alpha numeric, max 100 char, var length, etc
	- e.g. date, datetime, format
5. Get client sign-off
6. End of client interaction/involment
7. Assign datatype to each column
	- e.g. Cmobno - unsigned int
8. Assign the width for each Column
	- varchar(100)
9. Assign the not null, unique and check constraints (team activity)
10. For all practical purposes, you can have a single table with al these columns
11. Remove the computed columns (e.g. itemtotal, ototal)
	- e.g. select qty*rate from ....;
	- e.g. select sum(qty*rate) from ....;
12. Key element will be primary key of this table

- At this point, data is in Un-Normalised Form (UNF) 
- Un-Normalised Form -> Starting point of normalisation

### NORMALISATION

1. Remove repeating group into a new table
2. Key element will be primary key of new table
3. (This step may/maynot be required) Add the primary key of the original table to new table to give you composite primary key
- Above 3 steps are to be repeated infinitely till you cannot normalise any further   
- FIRST NORMAL FORM (FNF) (Signle Normal Form)(1NF)  
- Repeating groups are removed from designed   
- 1 : Many relationship is always encounterd here
- DEPT & EMP tables are in First Normal Form   
25%

4. Only the tables with composite primary key are examined
5. Those non-key elements that are not dependent on entire composite primary key, they are to be removed into a new table
6. Key element on which originally dependant, it is to be added to new table, & it''ll be the primary kay of new table
- Above 3 steps are to be repeated infinitely till you cannot normalise any further
- SECOND NORMAL FORM (SNF) (Double Noraml Form) (2NF)
- Every column is functionally dependent on Primary key
- Functional dependancy -> Without primary key, that column cannot function   
25% + 67% -> 92%

7. Only the non-key elements are examined for inter-dependancies
8. The inter-dependant column are to be removed to be removed into a new table
9. The key element will be the primary key of the new table, & the primary key of new table, that column, it is to be retained in the original table for relationship purposes
- Above 3 steps are to be repeated infinitely till you cannot normalise any further
- THIRD NORMAL FORM (TNF) (Triple Noraml Form)(3NF)
- Transitive dependancies (inter-dependancies) are removed from table design


### POST - NORMALISATION
1. Implement extention column
2. Reserve some columns for logs of DML operations
