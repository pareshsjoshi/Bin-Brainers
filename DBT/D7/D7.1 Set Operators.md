D7.1 Set Operators

### Set Operators
	- Foundation of RDBS based on Set theory
	- Dr. E. F. Codd is founder of RDBMS
	- UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, EXCEPT
```	
	EMP1				EMP2	
EMPNO	ENAME		EMPNO	ENAME
1		A			1		A
2		B			2		B
3		C			4		D
					5		E
```
##### UNION
<table>
<tr>
<td>

```sql
select empno1, ename from emp1
	union
select empno2, ename from emp2;
```
</td>
<td>

```
OUTPUT
EMPNO	ENAME
-----	-----
1		A
2		B
3		C
4		D
5		E
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>
 
	- Will combine the output of both the SELECT statements and it will suppress the duplicates
- Structure of both the SELECT statements has to be same
- Number of columns in both and the corresponding datatype have to match
- The column names may be different
- 1st select statement column name will reflect 2 different columns are mentioned in SELECT statement
- Order by clause should not be mentioned in 1st statement, it'll give error. Instead mention in in 2nd SELECT statement.
- Use - To combine OUTPUT of multiple tables

##### UNION ALL
<table>
<tr>
<td>

```sql
select empno1, ename from emp1
	union all
select empno2, ename from emp2;
```
</td>
<td>

```
OUTPUT
EMPNO	ENAME
-----	-----
1		A
1		A
2		B
2		B
3		C
4		D
5		E
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

- Union all will combine the output of both the SELECT statement and duplicates are not suppressed

##### INTERSECT
Intersect will return what is common in both the SELECT statements & duplicates are suppressed
<table>
<tr>
<td>

```sql
select empno1, ename from emp1
	intersect
select empno2, ename from emp2;
```
</td>
<td>

```
OUTPUT
EMPNO	ENAME
-----	-----
1		A
2		B
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

##### EXCEPT

- Except will return what is present in first SELECT statement & not present in the second SELECT statement & the duplicates are suppressed

<table>
<tr>
<td>

```sql
select empno1, ename from emp1
	except
select empno2, ename from emp2;
```
</td>
<td>

```
OUTPUT
EMPNO	ENAME
-----	-----
3		C
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

##### General
```sql
select ................
	union
select ................
	intersect
select ................
	union
select ................
	union all
select ................
	except
select ................
	order by x;
```
- Max upto 255 SELECT statements
- This limit of SQL can be exceeded with help of Views
- All are of equal precedence but brackets will have highest priority
- Need not to select from 2 table, can select form same table
<table>
<tr>
<td>

```sql
select job from emp where deptno = 10
intersect
select job from emp where deptno = 20;
JOB
-------
Manager
Clerk

select job from emp where deptno = 10
intersect
select job from emp where deptno = 20;
```
</td>
<td>

```sql
select job from emp where deptno = 10
except
select job from emp where deptno = 20;
JOB
-------
President

select job from emp where deptno = 10
intersect
select job from emp where deptno = 20;
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

```sql
select empno1, ename from emp1
	except
select empno2, ename from emp2;
```

### Psudo Columns 
- Fake columns(Virtual columns)
- It's not a column of the table, but you can use it in SELECT statement.
- eg. computed columns (sal*12 ANNUAL), Expressions (sal+comm-tax NET_EARNINGS), Function-based columns (avg(sal) AVG_SAL, round(sal, -3) R_SAL)

#### RDBMS supplied Pseudo columns
##### ROWID
- ROWID is a pseudo column
- Stands for Row Identifier
- It is not a column of the table, but you can use it in SELECT statement
- It is the ROW ADDRESS
- It is the actual physical memory location in DB server HD where that that row is located.
- When you select from table, the order of rows in output depends on the row ADDRESS; it will always be in ascending order of ROWID
- It is fixed-length, encrypted string of 18 characters
- When you insert a row, the address (ROWID) is constant for the life of the row
- When you update a row, if the length is descreasing, then address will not change
- When you update a row, if the length is increasing, and if free space is not availabel, then address may change
- No 2 rows of any table in the entire DB Server HD can have same ROWID
- ROWID works as unique identifier for every row in the database
- ROWID is used by MySQL to distinguish between two rows in the DB Server HD
- ROWID can be used to update or delete the DUPLICATE ROWs.
- ROWID is used internally by MySQL for Row locking, to manage indexes, to manage the cursors, to distinguish between 2 rows, row management, etc

```sql
select rowid, ename, sal from emp;
```

### Indexes	(Watch again)
```
			EMP Table
ROWID	EMPNO	ENAME	SAL		DEPTNO
X001	5		A		5000	1
X002	4		A		6000	1
X003	1		C		7000	1
X004	2		D		9000	2
X005	3		E		8000	2
```
- Indexes are present in all RDBMS, all DBMS and some of programming languages also.
- Used to speed up search operations (For faster access)
- Used to speed up select statement with a WHERE clause
- In MySQL, the indexes are automatically invoked by system as & when required.
- Execution plan -> It is plan created by MySQL as to how it is going to execute the SELECT statement
- In MySQL, the indexes are automatically updated by the system for all the DML operations
- Duplicate values are stored in an index
- No upper limit on the number of indexes per table
- Larger the number of indexes, the slower would be the DML operations.
- Cannot index text & blob columns
- NULL values are not stored in any index
- If you have 2 or more independent columns in the WHERE clause, then you create separate indexes for each column; MySQL will use necessary indexes as and when required.
- Composite index -> Combine 2 or more inter-dependent columns together in a single index
```
IND_DEPT_EMPNO
ROWID	DEPTNO	EMPNO
X001	1		1
X001	1		2
X001	1		3
X001	2		1
X001	2		2
```
- INDEX KEY - is set of columns on whose basis the index has been created
- Primary index key, here DEPTNO is Primary index key
- Seconary index key, here EMPNO is Seconary index key
- In MySQL, you can combine upto 32 columns in composite index.

- In MySQL, feature of ROWID is available, but you cannot view it.
- In Oracle, feature of ROWID is available, but you can view it.

```sql
select *  from emp where empno = 1;
select *  from emp where ename = 'C';
select *  from emp where sal > 7000;
```

#### When an Index should be created
- To speed up statement with WHERE clause
- If your SELECT retrieves <25% of table data, otherwise it'll slow down
- Your Primary Key column (unique column) should always be indexed
- Common column in join operations should always be indexed
```
		 DEPT Table
ROWID	DEPTNO	DNAME	LOC
Y011	1		TRN		Bby
Y012	2		EXP		Dlh
Y013	3		MKGT	Cal
```
```sql
select dname, ename from emp, dept
where dept.deptno = emp.deptno;
```
##### Create INDEX
Syntax -   
```sql 
create index indexname on table(column); 
```
```sql
create index i_emp_empno on emp(empno);
```
- Max 30 char allowed for index name
```sql
create index i_emp_ename on emp(ename);
create index i_emp_sal on emp(sal);
```
```sql
--To see which all indexes are created for specific table
show indexes from emp;
```
```sql
--To see all indexes on all table in the database
use information_schema;
select * from statistics;
```
```sql
--To drop index
drop index indexName on emp;
```
```sql
--To store index in descending order
create index i_emp_empno on emp(empno desc);
```
```sql
create index i_orders_onum on orders(onum desc);
```
```sql
create index i_emp_empno on emp(deptnpo, empno);
create index i_emp_empno on emp(deptnpo desc, empno);
create index i_emp_empno on emp(deptnpo, empno desc);
create index i_emp_empno on emp(deptnpo desc, empno desc);
```
```sql
create unique index i_emp_empno on emp(empno);
--Performs extra function, it won't allow to INSERT/UPDATE duplicate value in EMPNO
--At the time of creating the unique index, if you already have duplicate values in EMPNO, then MySQL will not allow you to create the unique index
```
- If you drop the table/column, then associated indexes are droped automatically.
- Will not allow to create two index for same column.
