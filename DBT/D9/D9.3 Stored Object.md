D9.3 Stored Object

## Stored Objects
- Objects that are stored in the DATABASE
	- e.g. CREATE ... tables, indexes; VIEWS, etc
- Anything that you do with CREATE Command is a stored object

### VIEWS
- Present in all RDBMSs and some of DBMS(Foxpro, excel)
- View is a handle to a table
- Stores the address of the table
- View is a HardDisk(HD) pointer -> Stores the address of table <- also known as LOCATOR
- Used for indirect access to the table
- Used for SECURITY Purposes
- Used to restrict access of users
- Max 30 characters
- View name - table name cannot be same
```sql
--To create a view
create view viewname ...;
```
```sql
--To create a view
create view viewname v1
	as
	select empno, ename from emp;
--OUTPUT -> View Created.
```
- Stored query V1=select empno, ename from emp
- Amit wants to share this view to scott
	```sql
	root_mysql> grant select on cdacmumbai.v1 to scott@localhost;
	- Here instead of giving access to table directly, we give access to restricted view of table
	```
- Now to access table scott have to 
```sql
root_mysql> select * from cdacmumbai.emp; --Wrong
root_mysql> select * from cdacmumbai.v1;	--Right
```
- View doesn't contain data, only the definition is store
- View is stored query
- SELECT statement on which the view is based, it is stored in the DB in COMPILED FORMAT
- View is executable format of SELECT statement
- Hence Execution will be fast
- Benifit of COMPILED FORMAT is hiding source code from end user
```sql
grant select, insert on cdacmumbai.v1 to scott@localhost
insert into cdacmumbai.v1 values(6, 'F');
```
- DML operations can be performed on View
- DML operations done on a view will affect the base table
- Constraints that are specified on table will enforced even when you insert via the view
- ENTIRE APPLICATION IS BASED ON VIEWS 
```sql
drop view v1;
```
```sql
create view v2
	as
select * emp where deptno = 1;
--used to restrict the row access
insert into v2 value(6, 'F', 6000, 2); --Allow
```
```sql
create view v2
	as
select * emp where deptno = 1 with check option;
--used to restrict the row access
insert into v2 value(6, 'F', 6000, 2); --ERROR
```
- View with check option is similar to check constraint
- Used to enforce different checks for different users
To change SELECT statement of view
```sql
drop view v1;
create view v1 as ......;
```
```sql
drop view v1;
create or replace view v1
as
select ename, sal emp;
```
```sql
drop view v1;
create view v1 as ......;
```
- Show Table
	- Will show tables & views but it won't tell which is table & which is View   
	To find out which is table & which is View
	```sql
	show full tables;
	desc emp; desc v1;
	```

#### View based on fake columns
<table>
<tr>
<td>

```sql
create or replace view v1
	as
select * upper(ename) "u_ename", sal*12 "Annual" from emp;
```
- View based on computed column, expression, function, order by clause, gourp by clause, etc.
- You can select from this view
- DML operations are not allowed
- Common for all RDBMS

</td>
<td>

```sql
create or replace view v1
	as
select dname, ename from emp, dept
where dept.deptno = emp.deptno;
```
- View based on join, sub-query, UNION, etc.
- You can select from this view
- DML operations are not allowed
- Common for all RDBMS

</td>
</tr>
</table>

- To see select statement on which view is based
```sql
show create view v1;
V1 = select .....
--Will get to see which select statement is used
```

#### View based on view is allowed
Users
	- To exceed the limit is allowed
		- UNION > 255 SELECT statements
		- Sub-query > 255 levels
		- Function withing function > 255 levels
	- To simplify the writing of complex SELECT statements
		- Join of 40 tables
		- Complex queries can be stored in view definition
