### Type of Joins (5)
1. Equi-join (Natural join)
	- Join based on equality condition
	- Shows me matching rows of both the tables
	- Most frequently use join (>90%), hence it is known as Natural join.
	- Will get data which is belong to group.
<table>
<tr>
<td>

```sql
select dname, ename, from emp, dept
where dept.deptno = emp.deptno;
```
</td>
<td>

```
OUTPUT
DNAME	ENAME
------	--------
TRN		Arun
TRN		Ali
TRN		Kirun
EXP		Jack
EXP		Thomas
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

2. in-equi-join (Non-equi-join)
	- Join based on inequality condition
	- Showns me non-matching rows of both the tables
	- Will get data which is not belong to group.
	- Used for Exception reports
		- Who are the emps who don't belong to Training
		- Who are the customers who haven't made the payment
<table>
<tr>
<td>

```sql
select dname, ename, from emp, dept
where dept.deptno != emp.deptno; 
```
</td>
<td>

```
OUTPUT
DNAME	ENAME
------	--------
TRN		Jack
TRN		Thomas
EXP		Arun
EXP		Ali
EXP		Kirun
MKTG	Arun
MKTG	Ali
MKTG	Kirun
MKTG	Jack
MKTG	Thomas
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

3. Outerjoin
	- Join with (+) sign, or if you use keyword "Outer"
	- Shows matching rows of both the tables PLUS non-matching rows of "Outer" table
	- Outer table -> Table with is on Outer side of (+) sign
	- Outer table -> Table with is on opposite side of (+) sign
	- Master-Detail Report (Parent-Child Report) 
	- Parent table (Master table) , Child table (Details table)    
	***Please note following***
	- (+) sign is not supported by MySQL
	- ANSI syntax for Right Outerjoin is supported by MySQL
	- ANSI syntax for Left Outerjoin is supported by MySQL
	- ANSI syntax for Full Outerjoin is supported by MySQL
		- Union of ANSI syntax for Right Outerjoin & ANSI syntax for Left Outerjoin
	1. Half outer join   
		- Here, dept is do-while loop & emp is for loop
		1. Right Outerjoin
<table>
<tr>
<td>

```sql
select dname, ename, from emp, dept
where dept.deptno = emp.deptno (+);
```
```sql
--ANSI syntax
select dname, ename form emp right outer join dept
on (dept.deptno = emp.deptno);
```
</td>
<td>

```
OUTPUT
DNAME	ENAME
------	--------
TRN		Arun
TRN		Ali
TRN		Kirun
EXP		Jack
EXP		Thomas
MKTG	empty/null
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>
		2. Left Outerjoin
Assume 6th emp - (6,'Scott', 8000, 4, C, 4);
<table>
<tr>
<td>

```sql
select dname, ename, from emp, dept
where dept.deptno (+) = emp.deptno;
```
```sql
--ANSI syntax
select dname, ename form emp left outer join dept
on (dept.deptno = emp.deptno);
```
</td>
<td>

```
OUTPUT
DNAME		ENAME
------		--------
TRN			Arun
TRN			Ali
TRN			Kirun
EXP			Jack
EXP			Thomas
empty/null	Scott
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>
	2. Full Outer join
	- Here, dept is do-while loop & emp is also do-while loop
	- Nested do-while loop
	- Shows matching rows of both the tables PLUS non-matching rows of both the tables
	- UNION of right Outerjoin and left Outerjoin
<table>
<tr>
<td>

```sql
select dname, ename, from emp, dept
where dept.deptno = emp.deptno (+)
	union
select dname, ename, from emp, dept
where dept.deptno (+) = emp.deptno;
```
```sql
--ANSI syntax
select dname, ename form emp full outer join dept
on (dept.deptno = emp.deptno);
```
```sql
select dname, ename, from emp right outer join dept
where dept.deptno = emp.deptno (+)
	union
select dname, ename, from emp left outer join dept
where dept.deptno (+) = emp.deptno;
--This will automatically suppress duplicates
```
</td>
<td>

```
OUTPUT
DNAME		ENAME
------		--------
TRN			Arun
TRN			Ali
TRN			Kirun
EXP			Jack
EXP			Thomas
MKTG		empty/null
empty/null	Scott
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

4. Inner join
	By default every join is Inner join; putting a (+) sign or using the keyword "Outer" is what makes it an Outerjoin
	- **DO NOT MENTION THIS IN INTERVIEW UNLESS EXPLICITLY ASKED BY INTERVIEWER**
5. Cartesian join (Cross join)
	- Join without a WHERE clause
	- Every row of driving table is combined with each and every row of driven table.
	- It takes the cross product of 2 table & therefore it's also known as Cross join.
	- Fastest Join (As no WHERE Clause resulting no searching)
	- Used for printing purposes
		- e.g. In students table you have all the students names, in SUBJECTS table you have all the subjects names; When you are printing the mark-sheets for the students, every student name is combined with each and every subject name.

<table>
<tr>
<td>

```sql
select dname, ename from emp, dept; 
--Fast (Lesser the I/O between Server HD & Server RAM, the faster it will be.
```
```sql
select dname, ename from dept, emp
order by 1;
--Slow (More the I/O between Server HD & Server RAM, the slower it will be.
```
</td>
<td>

```
OUTPUT
DNAME		ENAME
------		--------
TRN			Arun
TRN			Ali
TRN			Kirun
TRN			Jack
TRN			Thomas
EXP			Arun
EXP			Ali
EXP			Kirun
EXP			Jack
EXP			Thomas
MKTG		Arun
MKTG		Ali
MKTG		Kirun
MKTG		Jack
MKTG		Thomas
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

6. Self join
	- Joining a table to itself.
	- Used when parent column and child column, both are present in same table
	- Slowest join (Based on Recursion)
	- Use, Employee name & Manager name
	
<table>
<tr>
<td>

```sql
select a.ename, b.name from emp as b, emp as a
where a.mgr = b.empno;
```
</td>
<td>

```
OUTPUT
a.ENAME		b.ENAME
------		--------
Aun			Jack
Ali			Arun
Kirun		Arun
Thomas		Jack
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Joining 3 or More Tables
![D5 Draw3]()
<table>
<tr>
<td>

```sql
select dname, ename, dhead from emp, dept, depthead
where depthead.deptno = dept.deptno
and dept.deptno = emp.deptno;
--It's nested for loop upto 3 levels
```
</td>
<td>

```
OUTPUT
DNAME		ENAME		DHEAD
------		------		------
TRN			Arun		Arun
TRN			Ali			Arun
TRN			Kirun		Arun
EXP			Jack		Jack
EXP			Thomas		Jack
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Types of Relationships between tables
1. 1:1
	- Dept : Depthead
2. 1:Many
	- Dept : Emp, Depthead : Emp
3. Many:1
	- Emp : Dept, Emp : Depthead
4. Many:Many
	- 
```
			Projects	
ProjectNo	ClientName		Desc
P1			Deloitte		CGS
P2			Morgan Stanley	AMS
P3			BNM Paribas		Macros
P4			ICICI Bank		PPS
P5			AMFI			Website
```
Intersection Table
```
Project_Emp
ProjectNo	EmpNo
P1			1
P1			2
P1			4
P2			1
P2			5
P3			2
P3			4
```
Intersection table is required for Many:Many Relationship

```sql
select client)name, ename, from projects_emp, emp, projects
where projects_emp.projno = projects.projno
and projects_emp.empno = projects.empno
order by 1,2;
```
