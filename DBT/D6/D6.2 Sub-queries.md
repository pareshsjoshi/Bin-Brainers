D6.2 Sub-queries

### Sub-queries
- Subqueries are nested queries (i.e. Query withing query(SELECT withing SELECT))

Display the ENAME who is receiving SAL = min(SAL) :-
```sql
select ename from emp
where sal = (select min(sal) from emp);
--First SELECT statement is known as Main Query (Parent/Outer Query)
--Second SELECT statement is known as Sub Query (Child/Inner Query)
```
- Max upto 255 levels for Sub-queries
- This limit of SQL can be exceeded with the help of Views
- More the no of SELECT statement, the slower it'll be
- Less the no of SELECT statement, the faster it'll be
- In somecases, join queries can be replaced with Sub-queries; but Sub-queries is slower than join.

```sql
--2nd largest sal
select max(sal) from emp
where sal < (select max(sal) from emp);
```
```sql
--Display all the rows who belong to the same DEPTNO as 'Thomas'
select * from emp
where deptno = (
	select deptno from emp
	where ename = 'Thomas');
```

```sql
--Display all the rows who belong to the same JOB as 'Kirun'
select * from emp
where job = (
	select job from emp
	where ename = 'Kirun');
```

#### Using Sub-query with DML commands
1. In other RDBMS

```sql
delete * from emp
where deptno = (
	select deptno from emp
	where ename = 'Thomas');
```
```sql
update emp set sal = 10000
where job = (
	select job from emp
	where ename = 'Kirun');
```
- ABOVE 2 COMMSNDS WILL NOT WORK IN MySQL   
- IN MySQL YOU CANNOT UPDATE OR DELETE FROM A TABLE FROM WHICH YOU ARE CURRENTLY SELECTING

```
ABCD TABLE
  DEPTNO
	2
```
Can I do something like function to call instead of whole select statement.
```sql
delete * from emp
where deptno = (
	select abcd.deptno from (
		select deptno from emp
		where ename = 'Thomas') abcd);
```
```sql
update emp set sal = 10000
where job = (
	select pqr.job from (
		select job from emp
		where ename = 'Kirun') pqr);
```

#### Multi-row Sub-queries
Sub-query returns multiple rows
Display all the rows who are receiving sal = any of the managers
```sql
select * from emp
where sal =any(
	select sal from emp
	where job = 'M');
```
```sql
select * from emp
where sal IN(
	select sal from emp
	where job = 'M');
```
```sql
--usability
select * from emp
where deptno = 1 AND sal IN(
	select sal from emp
	where job = 'M') AND MGR = (SELECT...);
```

```sql
select * from emp
where sal >= (
	select min(sal) from emp
	where job = 'M');
```
- To make it work faster:-
	1. Try to solve the problem using join, bcz join is faster than sub-query
	2. Try to reduce the number of levels for sub-queries.
	3. Try to reduce the number of rows returned by sub-quary

- Assumption 3rd row SAL is 13000   

Display all the rows who are receiving SAL > all the managers
<table>
<tr>
<td>

```sql
select * from emp
where sal >all(
	select sal from emp
	where job = 'M');
```
</td>
<td>

```sql
select * from emp
where sal > (
	select max(sal) from emp
	where job = 'M');
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

ALL -> logical AND   
ANY -> logical OR   
IN -> logical OR 

#### Using Sub-query in HAVING clause
- Assimption 3rd row SAL is 3000
- Inline view - If you have sub-query in the FROM clause then it's known as Inline View.
Display DNAME that having max(sum(sal))

#### Correlate sub-query (Using the Exist operator)
- This is exception when sub-query is faster than join
- If you have join along with DISTINCT, to make it work faster use Correlated sub-query (use the EXISTS operator)   
Display the DNAMEs that contain employees & the DNAMEs that do contain employees

- First the main query is executed
- For every row returned by main query, it will run the sub-quary once
- sub-quary returns boolean TRUE value or FALSE value
- If sub-query returns TRUE value, then main query is eventually executed for that row
- If sub-query returns FALSE value, then main query is not executed for that row
- Unlike earlier, we do not use DISTINCT here, therefore no sorting takes place in Server RAM; this speeds it up
- Unlike a Join, the number of full table scans is reduce; this further speeds it up.
