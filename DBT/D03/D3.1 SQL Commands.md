- SELECTION - When you SELECT specific columns from table; it is known as SELECTION.
- Where clause - to view Specific rows
- PROJECTION - When you SELECT specific rows; it is known as PROJECTION.
- When you perform SELECTION or PROJECTION, you are viewing a subset of data
- To see which tables are created
	```show tables;```
- To see structure of table
	```desc table_name;```

- To suppress the duplicate/to get unique values
	```select distinct job from emp;```
	- DISTINCT takes time as internally DISTINCT run through every record and store unique value in array.
	- When you have LARGE number of rows in the table, this SELECT statement will  be slow.
	```select job, ename from emp;```
	- DISTINCT willl work on combination of all the columns that are present in select statement.

	```select deptno,job, ename, sal, hiredate, from emp;```

- In DBMS, Data is stored in file
- Inside files, rows are stored sequentially
- In DBMS, there is concept of row numbering, 
- In RDBMS, table is not a file, every row is file
- In RDBMS, rows of table are not stored sequentially, they are not stored in specific order
- Rows of table are scattered (fragmented) all over the database server HD.
- The reason why RDBMS does this is to speed up the insert statement.
- In a multi-user enviroment, when multiple users are inserting rows in same table simultaneously, if MySQL were to store the rows sequentially, then the insert operation would be very slow.
- When you INSERT a table, wherever MySQL finds the free spcae in the DB SERVER HD, it will store the row there.
- Where you SELECT from a table, the searching lexicographically (sequential)
- When you SELECT from a table, the order of rows in output depends on the row addressl it'll always be in ascending order of row address.
- Once you INSERT a row, the row address is constant.
- When you update a row, if the row length is increasing & free space is not available, then the entire row is moved to some other address on DB server HD>
- Later when you SELECT from table, you may see that row at some other location.
- It's only in case of VARCHAR that row length may increase or decrease
- Hence it is not possible to see first 'N' rows of a table or last 'N' rows of a table.
- This is common for all RDBMSs.
- There is a system table which stores all the table names & their row addresses
- When you SELECT from a table, MySQL will not search for the entire DB Server HD; rather it'll go to that system table and retrive the rows of the SELECTed table accoringly. (user_table)

### ORDER By clause

- To see rows in specific order
	- used for sorting
	- used for presentation/reporting purposes

```
select beptno, job, ename, sal, hiredate from emp
ORDER by ename; //ORDER by ename asc;
//By default ascending(asc) order
```
```
select beptno, job, ename, sal, hiredate from emp
ORDER by ename desc;
```
This is also known as Business Intelligence/Data Science/AI. All of them having base in SQL.
```
select beptno, job, ename, sal, hiredate from emp
ORDER by deptno, job;
```
```
select beptno, job, ename, sal, hiredate from emp
ORDER by deptno desc, job;
```
```
select beptno, job, ename, sal, hiredate from emp
ORDER by deptno desc, job desc;
```
- No upper limit on number of columns in ORDER BY clause.
- if you a large number of rows in the table, and a large number of columns in ORDER BY clause, then the SELECT statement will be slow, bcz that much sorting has to take place in Server RAM.
```
select beptno, job, ename, sal, hiredate from emp
WHERE deptno = 10
ORDER by deptno desc, job desc;
```
- SELECT statement executes from top to bottom & left to right.
- WHERE clause is used for searching; searching takes place in DB SErver HS
- WHERE clause is used to restrict rows
- WHERE clause is used to retrieve the reows from DB Server HD to SErver RAM
- ORDER BY clause sorting takes place in SERVER RAM
- ORDER BY clause is LAST CLAUSE in SELECT statement.
- WHERE clause has to specified before the ORDER clause.
```
select ename, sal*12 from emp
ORDER by sal*12;
```
```
select ename, sal*12 "ANNUAL" from emp
ORDER by "ANNUAL";
```
```
select ename, sal*12 "ANNUAL" from emp
ORDER by 2;
```
- ORDER BY 2 will sort by 2nd column.
- Alias can be used in ORDER BY clause, ORDER BY is performed in Server RAM & Alias is generated in Server RAM.
- Alias can't be used in WHERE clause, as WHERE action is performed in DB Server HD & Alias is generated in Server RAM.

### Blank-padded comparision semantics-

- When you compare 2 strings of different lengths, the shorter of the 2 strings is temporarily padded with blank spaces on RHS suchat their lengths become equal; then it will start comparision character by character based on ASCII value.

```
select * from emp
where ename > 'A' and ename < 'B';
//Starts with A (excluding A)
```
```
select * from emp
where ename >= 'A' and ename < 'B';
//Starts with A (including A)
```
```
select * from emp
where ename >= 'A' and ename < 'C';
//Starts with A,B (excluding C)
```
Wildcard
- '%' (percentage) - any character and any number of characters
- '_' (Underscore) - any one character
Special Operator (Like, Between, Any, In)
```
select * from emp
where ename like 'A%';
//Starts with A
```
```
select * from emp
where ename like '%A';
//Ends with A
```
```
select * from emp
where ename like '%A%';
//Contains with A
```
```
select * from emp
where ename not like 'A%';
//Not starting with A
```
```
select * from emp
where ename not like '__A%';
//Words with 3rd character A (2 underscores are used)
```
```
select * from emp
where ename not like '_I__';
//Names with 4 letters and 2nd letter as I (3 underscores are used)
```
```
select * from emp
where ename not like '____';
//Any word with 4 letters (3 underscores are used)
```
```
select * from emp
where sal >=2000 and sal <= 3000;
```
```
select * from emp
where sal between 2000 and 3000;
//Output will be same as above. Recommended.
```
```
select * from emp
where sal not between 2000 and 3000;
//Below 2k & above 3k
```
```
select * from emp
where hiredate between '2023-01-01' and '2023-12-21';
//Below 2k & above 3k
```
```
select * from emp
where hiredate not between '2023-01-01' and '2023-12-21';
//Below 2k & above 3k
```
```
select * from emp
where ename between 'A' and 'F';
//Start with A,B,C,D,E
```
-------------------------------
```
select * from emp
where deptno = 10 or deptno = 20 or deptno = 30;
//Most powerful
```
```
select * from emp
where deptno =any(10,20,30);
//Faster
```
```
select * from emp
where deptno = in(10,20,30);
//Fastest
```

ANY -> logical OR
IN -> logical OR

```
where deptno = in(10,20,30);
//Fastest

where deptno = not in(10,20,30);
//Fastest

where deptno =any(10,20,30);
//Faster
```
```
select * from emp
where deptno !=any(10,20,30);
//Faster

where deptno >any(10,20,30);
//Faster

where deptno >=any(10,20,30);
//Faster

where deptno <any(10,20,30);
//Faster

where deptno <=any(10,20,30);
//Faster
```

- ANY operator is overloaded (Operator Overloading)
- IN operator is faster that ANY Operator
- Any operator is more powerful than IN Operator
- With the IN operator, you can only check only for IN or NOT IN
- With the ANY operator, you can check =ANY, !=ANY, >ANY, >=ANY, <ANY, <=ANY
- If you want to check for equality or inequality, then use the IN operator
- If you want to check for >, >=, < or <=, then use ANY operator
- if your requirement is more complex, then use the Relational and Logical operator

- IN operator is supported by MySQL
- ANY operator is supported by MySQL only when it is used with sub-query.

### UPDATE

Syntax
````
update table_name
set column_name = new_value
where condition;
```
Example
```
update emp
set sal = 10000
where empno = 1;
```
```
update emp
set sal = sal + sal*04
where empno = 1;
```
Multiple Columns update
```
update emp
set sal = sal + sal*04, city = 'Pune'
where empno = 1;
```
```
update emp
set sal = 10000
where city = 'Mumbai';
```
Multiple Rows & Column update simultaneously
```
update emp
set sal = 10000, city = 'Pune'
where city = 'Mumbai';
```
- You can update multiple rows & multiple columns simultaneously, but you can UPDATE only 1 table in a single command
- If you want to UPDATE 2 or more tables, then a separate UPDATE command is needed for each table

Will update all the values in sal columns
```
update emp
set sal = 10000, city = 'Pune';
```

### DELETE

Syntax
```
delete from table_name
where condition
````
record with empno as 1 will be deleted
```
delete from emp 
where empno = 1;
```
record having city as Mumbai will be deleted
```
delete from emp 
where city = 'Mumbai';
```
Will delete all records from table, but the table will remain
```
delete from emp;
```

### Drop

Syntax
```
drop table table_name;
```
Example
```
drop table emp;
```
Drop multiple tables
```
drop table emp, dept;
```
You cannot have a WHERE with DROP table (bcz DROP is DDL cmd)

### Transaction Processing
##### COMMIT
- Commit will save all the DML changes since the last commited state.
- DML changes are INSERT, UPDATE, ..
- Syntax
```
commit work;
or
commit;
```
- Work is optional in MySQL.
- When the user issues a COMMIT, it is known as end of transaction.
- COMMIT will make the transaction permanent. Otherwise it'll be temporary.
- Total work done = sum of work done in individual transactions(T1+T2+..+Tn;)
- When to use commit is depend on user, not developer, and it depends on the logical scope of work

##### DDL command
```
insert ...
insert ...
insert ...
insert ...
create table customer...
```
- Any DDL command automatically commits; not only will it commit itself, it will commit all DML changes before it.

##### ROLLBACK
- Rollback will undo all the DML changes since the last committed state
- What is commited cannot be rolled back.
Syntax
```
rollback work;
or
rollback;
```
- Only the DML cammands are affected by ROLLBACK & COMMIT
- Work is optional in MySQL.

##### EXIT
- When you EXIT from SQL, the system automatically commits (save & exit). It'll commit in itself.
- Any kind of power failure, network failure, system failure, PC reboot, windows close, improper exit from SQL, etc; you last uncommited transaction is automatically Rolled back.

##### SAVEPOINT
- Savepoint is a point within your work
- Savepoint is similar to bookmark
- Savepoint is similar to milestone within your Transaction
- You can rollback to Savepoint
- You cannot commit to savepoint
- Commit will save all the DML changes since the last committed state
- When you Rollback or Commit, the intermediate Savepoint are cleared; if you want to use them again, then you will have to reissue them in some new work
```
rollback work to pqr;
or
rollback to pqr;
```
- work is optional in MySQL.
- You  can only Rollback sequentially
- Savepoint name can be of max 30 characters.
- Withing a Transaction, you can have 2 Savepoints with the same name.
- The latest Savepoint supoercedes the previous one.
- The older Savepoint not longer exists.

### Environment Setting
```
set autocommit = 1; //switching it on
set autocommit = 0; //switching it off
```
