D4.1 Read & Write Consistancy

### Read & Write Consistancy
- In a multi-user environment when you select from a table you can view only committed data of all users plus/union the changes made by you.

##### ACID properties in RDBMS
- A -> Atomicity
	- Entire transaction takes place at once or it doesn't happen at all (e.g. You withdraw Rs. 500/- from your bank account....)
- C -> Consistancy
	- The data base must be consistant before & after the transaction. (e.g. same as above, Deposits/Withdrawals & Balances tables)
- I -> Isolation
	- Multiple transactions occur independently without interference.
- D -> Durability
	- The changes of successful transaction are permanently saved even if later system failure occurs.

##### OPTIMISTING Locking
- It is automatic row locking mechanism in MySQL
- When you UPDATE or DELETE a row, that row is automatically locked for other users
- Row locking in MySQL is automatic
- when you UPDATE or DELETE a row, that row become read_only for other users.
- Other users can select from that table; they will view old data before your changes.
- Other users can insert rows into that table without any issue
- Other use can UPDATE or DELETE other rows from that table
- No other user can UPDATE or DELETE your locked row till you have issued a Rollback or Commit
- LOCKS ARE AUTOMATICALLY RELEASED WHEN YOU ROLLBACL OR COMMMIT.

##### PESSIMISTIC Locking
- Lock the manually in advance, before issuing UPDATE or DELETE.
- To lock the rows mannually, you have to use SELECT state with the FOR UPDATE clause.
```sql
select * from emp
FOR UPDATE;
--It'll lock whole table, not recommended
```
- Lockes are automatically released when you Rollback or Commit.
```sql
select * from emp
where empno = 101
FOR UPDATE;
--It'll lock selected rows
--By default it'll wait in request queue till rows are released
```
```sql
select * from emp
where empno = 101
FOR UPDATE nowait;
--If selectd rows are locked it'll get error
```
```sql
select * from emp
where empno = 101
FOR UPDATE wait;
--If selectd rows are locked it'll wait till rows are released
```
```sql
select * from emp
where empno = 101
FOR UPDATE wait 60;
--If selectd rows are available it'll lock it, else it'll wait for 60s; if row is still unavailable, then it'll abort the operation.
```
