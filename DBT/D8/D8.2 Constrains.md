D5.2 Constrains

## Constrains
- Limitations/restrictions imposed on a table
```
empno	ename	sal	dept
1		A		5000	1
2		A		6000	1
3		C		7000	1
4		D		9000	2
5		E		8000	2
```
### PRIMARY KEY
- Key is another word for column
- Primium column
- Column or set of columns that uniquely  identifies a row e.g. empno
- Duplicates values ar not allowed; it has to be unique 
- Null values are not allowed; this is mandatory column
- It's recommended that very table should have PRIMARY key; it helps in long-term perspective
- Purpose of PRIMARY KEY is row uniqueness; with the help of PRIMARY kry column you can distinguish between 2 rows of table
- TEXT and BLOB cannot be Primary Key
- Unique index is automatically created for Primary Key(because Primary Key is 
the best column for searching)
- COMPOSITE PRIMARY KEY -> combine 2 or columns together to server the Purpose of PRIMARY KEY; preferably they should be interdependent columns
- you can combine upto 32 columns in composite PRIMARY KEY
- If yyou have Composite PRIMARY KEY, then Composite unique index is automatically created.
- You can have only 1 PRIMARY KEY per table
- Candidate key - is not a constraint
- Candidate key - is a defination
- It is PRIMARY KEY is in waiting
- Candidate key - besides the PRIMARY KEY, any other column in table that could server purpose of PRIMARY KEY, is good candidate for PRIMARY KEY, is known as Candidate KEY
- SURROGATE KEY -> It is not a constraint
- SURROGATE KEY -> It is a defination
- SURROGATE KEY -> When you add extra column to table to server the purpose of PRIMARY KEY, then such a PRIMARY KEY is known as SURROGATE KEY.
- PRIMARY KEY is best column for searching, and with CHAR datatype the searching & retrieval is very fast; therefore for SURROGATE KEY, the CHAR datatype is recommended.

##### How to identify PRIMARY KEY
1. Identify some key column & make it PRIMARY KEY of your table
2. If you cannot identify some key column, then try to implement composite PRIMARY KEY
3. If this is not possible, then add an extra column to the table to server the purpose of PRIMARY KEY(SURROGATE KEY)
```sql
create table emp
(
empno char(4) PRIMARY KEY,
ename varchar(25),
sal float,
deptno int
);
```
```sql
insert in emp value('5', 'F', 5000, 2);
insert in emp value(null,'F',5000,2);
--ERRORS
```
- All constrains are at server level; you can perform the DML operations using MySQL command line client or MySQL workbench, or Java or MS .Net or any other front-end s/w, the constrains will always be valid (this feature is known as DATA INTEGRITY)

```sql
select * from information_schema.table_constraints;
select * from information_schema.table_constraints
where table_schema = 'cdeacmumbai';
select * from information_schema.key_column_usage
where table_name = 'emp';
```
- unique index automatically created
```sql
show indexes from emp;
```
- To DROP PRIMARY KEY
```sql
alter table emp drop PRIMARY KEY;
```
- To add PRIMARY KEY to existing table
```sql
alter table emp add PRIMARY KEY(empno);
```
- To change the PRIMARY KEY column ->drop the existing Primary key constraint & alter table & then we can add new primary key constraint

- To do Composite PRIMARY KEY
```sql
create table emp
(
empno char(4),
ename varchar(25),
sal float,
deptno int,
PRIMARY KEY(deptno, empno)
);
```

```sql
alter table emp drop PRIMARY KEY;
alter table emp add PRIMARY KEY(deptno, empno);
```

##### Types of constraint
1. Column level constraint
	- constraint specified on one column
2. Table level constraint
	- Composite
	- Constraint specified on combination of 2 or more columns
	- Has to be specified at the end of the table structure
	
#### NOT NULL CONSTRAINT
- Null values are not allowed 
- Duplicate value are allowed
- Always a column level constraint

```sql
create table emp
(
empno char(4),
ename varchar(25) not null,
sal float not null,
deptno int not null
);
```
1. Entity Integrity -> PRIMARY KEY
2. Referential Integrity -> Foreign KEY
3. Domain Integrity -> Datatype

- In MySQL, nullability is part of datatype to see the not null columns
```sql desc emp; ```
- To DROP the not null constraint
```sql alter table emp modify ename varchar(25) null; ```
- To add the not null constraint to existing table
```sql alter table emp modify ename varchar(25) not null; ```

#### UNIQUE CONSTRAINT
- Duplicate values are not allowed
- Null values are allowed
- Can INSERT any number of null values, but not duplicate values
- unique index is automatically created
- text and blob cannot be unique
- In MySQL, you can combine upto 32 columns in composite unique.
- YOU CAN HAVE ANY NUMBER OF UNIQUE CONSTRAINT PER TABLE, UNLIKE PRIMARY KEY.
- e.g Mobile number
```sql
create table emp
(
empno char(4),
ename varchar(25),
sal float,
deptno int,
mobi_no char(15) unique,
unique(deptno, empno)
);
```
```sql
select * from information_schema.table_constraints;
select * from information_schema.table_constraints
where table_schema = 'cdeacmumbai';
select * from information_schema.key_column_usage
where table_name = 'emp';
```
```sql
show indexes from emp;
--mob_no
--deptno
```
- Unique constraint is index
- To DROP it
```sql
drop index mob_no on emp;
drop index deptno on emp;
```
- To add unique constraint to existing table
```sql
alter table emp add constraint u_emp_mob_no unique(mob_no);
constraint u_emp_mob_no --constraint constraintName
constraint u_emp_mob_no --optional
```
- Column level constraint can be defined as table level constraint except NON NULL constraint
- But table level composit constraint cannot be defined as column level constraint
```sql
create table emp
(
empno char(4),
ename varchar(25),
sal float,
deptno int,
mobi_no char(15),
unique(deptno, empno),
unique(mob_no)
);
```
- Most developers prefer this, it make the CREATE table command more readable
- Column level constraint can be specified at table level (end of structure), except for NOT NULL constraint which is always a column level constraint and therefore the syntax will not support you from specifying it at table level

- 1 Column can have more than 1 constraint. e.g. PRIMARY KEY & FOREIGN KEY, NOT NULL and UNIQUE
```
Solution for Candidate KEY
not null constraint + unique index
OR
not null constraint + unique constraint
```
- With help of above logic, indirectly you can have multiple PRIMARY KEY in the table; one directly, the remaining indirectly

ALTERNATE KEY -> is not constraint
ALTERNATE KEY -> is defination
ALTERNATE KEY -> for Candidate KEY column, if you give it a NOT NULL constraint + unique index/constraint, then it becomes an alternative to PRIMARY KEY, then such a Candidate KEY column is known as ALTERNATE KEY

SUPER KEY -> is not a constraint
SUPER KEY -> is defination
SUPER KEY -> if you have 1 or more alternate keys in table, then the PRIMARY KEY is also known as SUPER KEY

### Foreign KEY
- Foreign column (column that is coming/derived from elsewhere)
- Column or set of columns that refernce from a column or set of column of some table
- Foreign key constraint is specified on the chield column (not the parent column)
- Parent column has to be PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE (this is pre-requisite for Foreign key)
- Foreign key will allow duplicate values
- Foreign key will allow null values also 
- Foreign key may reference column of same table also (known as self-referencing) (parent column & child column both are present in the same table)

```sql
create table dept(
deptno int PRIMARY KEY,
dname varchar(15),
loc varchar(10)
);

```
```sql
create table emp(
empno char(4) PRIMARY KEY,
ename varchar(25),
sal float,
mgr char(4),
constraint fk_emp_deptno foreign key(deptno)
reference dept(deptno),
constraint fk_emp_mgr foreign key(mgr)
reference emp(empno)
);
```
- To DROP
```sql
alter table emp drop Foreign KEY fk_emp_deptno;
```
- To ADD again
```sql
alter table emp add Foreign KEY(deptno) reference dept(deptno);
```
- To disable the foreign KEY constraint
```sql
--for current connection
set Foreign_key_checks = 0;
set Foreign_key_checks = 1;
```
- To disable the foreign KEY constraint for all connection
```sql
--for all connection
set global Foreign_key_checks = 0;
set global Foreign_key_checks = 1;
```
- You cannot delete parent row when child row exists
- ON DELETE CASCADE -> If you delete the parent row then, MySQL will automatically delete the child rows as well
```sql
create table emp(
empno char(4) PRIMARY KEY,
ename varchar(25),
sal float,
mgr char(4),
constraint fk_emp_deptno foreign key(deptno)
reference dept(deptno) on delete cascade,
constraint fk_emp_mgr foreign key(mgr)
reference emp(empno)
);
```

- ON UPDATE CASCADE -> If you update the parent row then, MySQL will automatically update the child rows as well
```sql
create table emp(
empno char(4) PRIMARY KEY,
ename varchar(25),
sal float,
mgr char(4),
constraint fk_emp_deptno foreign key(deptno)
reference dept(deptno) on delete cascade on update cascade,
constraint fk_emp_mgr foreign key(mgr)
reference emp(empno)
);
```
- If you want to retain child rows
```sql
update emp set deptno = null where deptno = 2;
delete from dept where deptno =2;

update dept set deptno = 4 where deptno = 2;
```
- First it inserts, then it checks for the constraint; and it will allow
- constraint is deffered, post-insert
- First it inserts, then it checks for the constraint; then it will Rollback and give an error
- If "delete from emp where empno = 1;"
- avoid on delete cascade in the event of self-referencing; you may delte more rows than expected.
